# An invitation to Data Science

In this repository you will find 4 Jupyter notebooks introducing topics in Data Science. I designed this course for a two day session in National Student's Academy summer camp 2020. The intended listeners were high-school students with some familiarity with programming (not neccessarily in Python!), otherwise the notebooks try not to assume knowledge of probabily and mathematics above 9th grade level.  

## Topics covered:
* Part 1: introduction to logarithms, probability, random variables.
* Part 2: maximum likelihood estimation, linear regression, the basics of unsupervised and supervised learning.
* Part 3: expected value, confidence intervals, bayesianims and frequentism.
* Part 4: Hidden Markov Chain models, stationary distribution, Viterbi algorithm.

The best way to use this material is to download it and upload the notebooks to https://colab.research.google.com/. In this repository there are a couple of datasets which the exercises will prompt you to upload to continue the analyses.

## Acknowledgements

This course is inspired by the many teacher I have had. Most notably Dr. Damon Wischik who introduced me to Data Science and Python during [IB Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/DataSci/) course at the University of Cambridge. I hope to give my own interpretation for all topics but I will somewhat inevitably borrow examples and ideas from my previous experiences.
